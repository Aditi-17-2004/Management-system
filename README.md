The Hotel Management System is a Java-based application that helps manage hotel operations such as adding rooms, booking rooms, checking out guests, and viewing room availability. It uses an object-oriented approach with classes for rooms and customers, and stores data in memory. This console-based version is simple, user-friendly, and can be expanded with database integration or a GUI for real-world use.
